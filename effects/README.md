# effects

isolated implementations of individual physical effects for reference and testing

## planned effects

- channel-length modulation: finite output resistance in saturation
- body effect: threshold voltage modulation by v_sb
- velocity saturation: carrier velocity limitations in short channels
- subthreshold conduction: weak inversion current below threshold
- drain-induced barrier lowering (dibl): threshold voltage reduction with v_ds
- mobility degradation: vertical field effects on carrier mobility
- temperature effects: parameter variations with temperature
